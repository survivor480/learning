To view the ip address, we can view it in ifconfig
We can also view the ip address using the ip address show
It can also be seen by ip addr show or ip a show
All of them work the same.
We can also omit the show command because it is the default behaviour of the command.
ip a also works the same as the others

To view the ipv4 address, we can have a look at ip -4 address
To view the ipv6 address, we can have a look at ip -6 address

We can view the details of a specific interface by the following command
ifconfig enp0s3
ip addr show dev enp0s3

Both work the same
Short form of the second one is ip a s dev enp0s3

To set an interface down, ip link set enp0s3 down.

We can configure the ip of the particular interface, 
ifconfig enp0s3 192.168.0.111/24 up

To remove the existing details of an interface,
ip address del 192.168.0.111/24 dev enp0s3
To add the new details in the interface
ip address add 192.168.0.222/24 dev enp0s3

The route -n shows the default gateways for the different interfaces.
To add a new default gateway for the interfaces, we can do the following procedure
ip route show
This shows the routes and the default configuration.
To delete the default configuration ip route del default.
To add the default configuration again, ip route add default via 192.168.0.1

To change the mac address of the interface, 
ifconfig enp0s3 down
ifconfig enp0s3 hw ether 08:00:27:51:05:09
ifconfig enp0s3 up

To change it by avoiding so many commands,
ip link set dev enp0s3 address 08:00:27:51:05:01

Q) How can you display the DNS Servers used by the system?
Answer: Run resolvectl status





The default configuration of ssh is not very secure.
The server configuration file is can be viewed in ls -l /etc/ssh/
The server configuration file is named sshd_config

Note that there is another file called ssh_config which is the settings for the client side.
The sshd_config file stands for ssh daemon.

The port can be changed from uncommenting the line which says # Port 22. The default port for ssh is 22.
It is highly recommended to change the port number for this since someone trying to take control of the system
will get access to the system very easily since it the default port.
We can also set the Permit Root Login to no since it is by default at prohibit-password.
Anybody having the public key file for login can get access to the system which is something we dont want.

We should configure the ssh upto the firewall level. If the connection has to be made by a limited number of places,
accept connections from a limited number of IP Addresses.

For me to accept only a limited connections from a specific ip addresses, we can run the following command

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2278 -s 2.2.4.5 -j ACCEPT 
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2278 -s 2.45.6.100 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2278 -j DROP 

This accepts connections from a specific ip only.

We can also change the clientaliveinterval to anytime in seconds and also change the clientalivecountmax to 0-any number.

SCP stands for secure copy and it helps in secure copy of a file from a client to a host.
The scp command can be used to do either of the three things, copy file from client to server, 
server to client or server to server.

The command is as follows

scp -P 2278 ip.txt student@192.168.0.20:~

This copies the file to the server home directory.
In case we want it under a different name to the target machine, we can have it as
student@192.168.0.20:~/ip_centos.txt

To copy a directory, we can use the -r option which stands for recursive.
The syntax is as follows:

scp -r -P 22mydir1/ student@192.168.0.20:~


When copying a file, the one who is sending file should have read permission on the file.
The user on the server should have the write permission for writing the file.

To copy something on my machine, we have have the following command run

scp student@192.168.0.20:/etc/passwd /home/student/Desktop/


SFTP has more capabilities than scp since it can resume incomplete transfers. SFTP is more complex than SCP.
WinSCP for Windows and Filezilla are GUI interpretations for copying files.

rsync is used for professional backups and other stuff. This is usually an advanced copy command in linux.

rsync -av /etc/ ~/etc-backup/

This will copy the folder to the backup folder.

The -a option in rsync is telling rsync to run in archive mode. It means it will copy files recursively.
This method also preserves symlinks.
The -v option tells rsync to run in verbose mode.

If we copy the same file and execute the same rsync file again, it does not copy anything at all since
it detects that it is the same thing and it was done.

rsync looks for files that have changed in modified time or in size.

If we dont want any summary messages or any message to be displayed. We can use -q which stands for quiet.

To enable mirroring in both the files, we can use the --delete option.
Like
sudo rsync -av --delete /etc/ ~/etc-backup/

Linux has almost the same treatment for directories if we add a trailing slash or not. But rsync does gives different
treatment for them.

To exclude select files from the rsync , we can use the following treatment.

We create a file called exclude_files.txt which consists of the following content,

movie1.mkv
dir1/
*.png

rsync -av --exclude-from='./exclude_files.txt' my_project/ backup/

sudo rsync -av -e ssh /etc/ student@192.168.0.20:~/etc-centos/

This is how we copy the folder using rsync over ssh.

To specify ssh port in rsync, we can use

sudo rsync -av -e 'ssh -p 22' --delete /etc/ student@192.168.0.20:~/etc-centos/

rsync -av -e ssh student@192.168.0.20:~/my_project .

wget can be used to download a file from http, https and ftp servers

To save the file in another directory,

wget -P kali/ link_for_the_file

To limit the bandwidth to a limited speed, we can use the --limit-rate option.
wget --limit-rate=100k -P kali/ link_to_be_downloaded

Adding the -c option lets us resume the download from where it ended.

To download multiple files at once, we can have write a file called links.txt and then write the following command

wget -i links.txt

To run the download in the background, we can use the -b option with this command.

To view the log file, we can use

tail -f wget-log

To kill the download, we can use pkill wget.

If we use the nohup signal, we can make it immune to the terminal close action. This will not put any effect on the process
even if the terminal closes.

Sometimes we want to save a website offline copy for some future use, we can get that easily using wget

wget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites --no-parent link_to_the_website

--mirror among other things makes the download recursive.

--convert-links converts all the css paths and files to relative paths for offline viewing.

--adjust-extension will adjust the suitable file name extensions depending on their file type.

--page-requisites will also download css stylesheets and images to properly view the webpage offline.

--no-parent is necessary not to ascend to the parent directory as well.

We can also shorten the command like

wget -mkEpnp link_to_the_website

To view the list of all the services running on the machine we can have

sudo netstat -tupan

-t shows tcp ports 
-u shows udp ports 
-p shows process id and the name of the program that is listening.

ss is a similar command to netstat.
Someway down the line it might replace netstat.
since it is faster than netstat.

ss -tupan

another useful command is lsof which is list of all files that are opened by any process in the system

To get the processes opened by a specific user

lsof -u student

To view all the files that are not opened by the user root, we can have the following command

lsof -u ^root

To view the files opened by a specific process, we can use the -c option

sudo lsof -c nginx

To view the files that have opened TCP ports, we can use the following command

sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN 

To view the ports in numeric format, we can use the -nP option

sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -nP

To view the details of a specific port, we can have the following command

sudo lsof -iTCP:22 -sTCP:LISTEN -nP

To check if the port 22 is open on centos, I can run 

telnet 192.168.0.113 22

We can also have this in telnet google.com 443. This returns a successful message.

To view the most used ports and a summary of a machine, we can use

sudo nmap 192.168.0.113

To see if the port 80 is open on linux.com, 

nmap -p 80 linux.com

To view the contents of the file, we can view it with the archive manager
We can view the entire contents of the deb file using the archive manager,

The dpkg database contains the list of all the installed software on the current system.
It is not responsible to solve any dependencies.
Note that tools like apt will call dpkg behind the scenes since they are based on dpkg

To see info about the deb file, we can use 
dpkg --info google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

To install the deb file, we can run the following command

dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

To view all the installed programs,
dpkg --get-selections

dpkg-query -l

The ii in the output indicated the status which is install and the second is installed

To list all the files installed related to a particular package, run 

dpkg -l google-chrome-stable 

Suppose a file got corrupted and we want to know which package the file belongs to
Example, the ls package got corrupted, we can view the files of ls command by using
which -a ls

Now we want to see to which package it belongs to,
we can use dpkg -S /bin/ls

To remove a package we can use,
dpkg -r google-chrome-stable

The -r option does not remove the configuration files, so we can use the -P option to remove the configuration files as well

APT- Advanced Package Tool 

The recommended way to manage software packages on Ubuntu and other Debian based distributions is using apt
In the newest versions of Ubuntu the apt-get and apt-cache tools were merged into a single command simply called apt.
Unlike dpkg, apt does not understand .deb files. It works with packages that are downloaded from repositories and calls
dpkg directly after downloading the .deb archives.
An APt repositories is a web server which contains a collection of packages with metadata that is readable by apt tool.
A special kind of repository hosted on servers like Launchpad are PPAs.

The full form of PPA is Personal Package archives

To upgrade the entire system, we can use sudo apt full-upgrade

ls -l /var/cache/apt/archives/

This is the directory that contains all installed and upgraded packages.

To clean the local directories to keep the machine clean, we can run
apt clean

To find the list of all the packages that can be installed we can run
apt list

apt list | grep postfix

To find a particular package in the repositories

To find a package related to a particular phrase, we can Use

apt search "transparent proxy"

To see the number of installed packages we can use
apt list --installed | wc -l

To view the details of a particular packages, we can Use

apt show apache2

There are also some of the graphical package managers, like synaptic

The advantages and disadvantages of source compilation are as follows:

Advantages

You can compile applications with certain options which may be 
missing or disabled in the standard distribution package.

Access to the latest version of an application

Its possible to have multiple versions of the same program installed

Disadvantages

The package manager will be completely unaware of the changes you've made. It won't
be possible to update or remove the application using the package manager.

If you are not careful when compiling to install the program in seperate location you can break
your system.

It's not the easiest job

Source Compilation Guide

1) Install the prerequisites: gcc, g++, make
    Ubuntu: sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential
    CentOS: sudo dnf group install "Development Tools"
2) Download the source files from the official website.
3) Check the integrity of the tarball(hash or digital signature)
4) Extract the archive and move into the resulting directory
5) Run: ./configure --help and set the required compilation options
6) Run: make
7) Run: make install
